INSTALLATION

Check for any other README files in this directory that relate to your
particular platform.  Feel free to contribute a README for your platform or to
provide updates to any existing documentation.

The first step is to configure PyQtChart by running the following command.

	python3 configure.py

This assumes that the correct Python interpreter is on your path.  Something
like the following may be appropriate on Windows.

	c:\python35\python configure.py

If you have multiple versions of Python installed then make sure you use the
interpreter for which you wish to generate bindings for.

The configure.py script takes many options.  Use the "--help" command line
option to display a full list of the available options.

The next step is to build PyQtChart using your platform's make command.

	make

The final step is to install PyQtChart by running the following command.
(Depending on your system you may require root or administrator privileges.)

	make install
